This is a Doctor–Patient Appointment Management System built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures.

The system helps manage doctor appointments by:

Adding patient appointments with date and time

Preventing double booking (time conflicts)

Viewing pending and checked appointments

Marking appointments as checked after consultation

Managing multiple doctors separately

Appointments are stored using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient searching and sorting by date and time.
This project is completely menu-driven, works in the console, and focuses on logic, validation, and clean structure.
